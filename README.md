# iOS-downgrade-tethered

### Description
#### Downgrade methods from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/7v6pxu/release_tutorial_how_to_downgrade_any_32_bit)

#### A simple downgrade script which can downgrade 32-bit devices to ANY version.

Currently supported device is iPad3,1. Supported iOS is iOS 7-9.1. More will add in the future.

#### IMPORTANT: This tool does not use any BootROM exploits.
#### Do not power off your device if you have downgraded your device using this tool. It will BRICK your device. 
#### The only way to power off is: jailbreak your device, then run `./kloader pwnediBSS` in your shell.

#### If your device is supported by checkm8 exploitation tool (such as [ipwndfu](https://github.com/axi0mX/ipwndfu)), maybe you can still boot even you have powered off your device.
